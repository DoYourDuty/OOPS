OOPs- Object Orientated Programming
Problem with functional programming – Reusability, Extensibility, Simplicity, Maintainability	
Reusability – Class and Object
Extensibility – Inheritance, Aggregation and Composition
Simplicity – Abstraction, Encapsulation and Polymorphism
Maintainability – RES all 3 combined 

Abstraction – Show only necessary property
Encapsulation – Make component/Interface more simplicity by hiding inner complex detail from the external.
Inheritance – Parent and child relationship extend.
Polymorphism – Depending on condition it will change the roll/logic
